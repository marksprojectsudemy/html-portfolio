  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Mark, I am currently working as a Media Designer for a private label packaging company.
    Right now I am preparing for an opportunity which allows me to become a Junior Developer at my company,
    so I am taking Angela's Course.  
  </p>

  <p>
    I already have experience in Javascript, which I use to automate my company's work processes for adobe products.
    In my spare time I also love designing and developing video games using Godot and Unity.
  </p>

    That's about it. Thank you for reading, as a reward you shall receive a <a href="https://krugss.itch.io/" id="hehe" target="_blank">link</a> to the small web games I have already published
    on my itch.io page! <i>If you can find it that is.</i>
