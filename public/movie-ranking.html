    <h1>The Best Movies According To Mark</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
    <h4>The Fellowship of the Ring, and the other two</h4>
    <p>This was the first movie I watched of the Lord of the Rings franchise and I fell in love with it.</p>
    <h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
    <h4>The first one</h4>
    <p>As a child I loved dinosaurs (still do) so this was an instant favorite, even if it wasn't age appropriate...</p>
    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>I have to agree with Angela, this movie is awesome! Still love it.</p>
    <h3>The Conjuring</h3>
    <h4>Again, the first one</h4>
    <p>My mother loves horror movies and I inherited that love for them too!</p>
    <h3>Scary Movie</h3>
    <h4>1 to 4 I think?</h4>
    <p>It's been a while since I watched this one, but I remember it fondly...</p>
