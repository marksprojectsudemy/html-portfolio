    <a href="./public/movie-ranking.html" ><h3>Move Ranking Project</h3></a>
    <p>
        This is the <strong>first project</strong> of many from Angela Yu's udemy course on web development. The point of the project
        was to use the <strong>Header Tags</strong> to display important information correctly, as well as to utilize the <strong>Paragraph 
        Tag</strong> for easy to read text.<br />As a bonus we also learned about <strong>Void Elements</strong>, which are self closing Tags 
        fulfilling a specific purpose. For example, the hr tag creates a horizontal line.

    <a href="./public/birthday-invite.html" ><h3>Birthday Invite Project</h3></a>
    <p>
        Next up is the <strong>Birthday Invite Project.</strong> The goal of this project is to utilize <strong>lists</strong>,
        unsorted lists in this case, and use the <strong>Anchor Tags</strong> and <strong>Image Elements</strong> to create a 
        personal birthday invite. The knowledge of the previous project is also required. <br />
        The image of the birthday cake is an external link, which has to be included using the src attribute.
        The Google Maps link is the Anchor Tag and leads to a surprising gathering of the minds. <i>Exciting!</i>
